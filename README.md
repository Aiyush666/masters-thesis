In the master’s thesis project at Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Kolkata, I am trying to develop explicit forms of Adiabatic to Diabatic Transformation (ADT) equations have been devised for coupled three-state electronic manifold in terms of ADT angles. The numerical instability originated from singularity of NACTs is removed by using ADT matrices, which transform the adiabatic Schrödinger equation (SE) to its diabatic form. In this project, pyridine Radical Cation (𝑪𝟓𝑯𝟓𝑵+) is selectively chosen for demonstration of ADT equations for three electronic states of (𝑪𝟓𝑯𝟓𝑵+) in which many types of non-adiabatic interactions i.e. Pseudo Jahn-Teller (PJT) interactions and accidental conical intersections (CIs) are prevailing. For (𝑪𝟓𝑯𝟓𝑵+) cation 𝑄3_𝑄7 and 𝑄5_𝑄16 normal mode pairs are taken as nuclear configuration spaces (CSs) to investigate the utility of Beyond Born-Oppenheimer (BBO) equations for three coupled electronic states. Intense vibronic coupling prevailing within the low-lying three electronic states of this cation, namely in the Frank-Condon region is the key mechanistic element for dictating the photoelectron spectrum. We have calculated ab initio adiabatic potential energy surfaces (PESs) and NACTs among the 
lowest three electronic states at the Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF) level using MOLPRO quantum chemistry package. Subsequently, ADT is carried out using those newly developed equations to validate the positions of CIS, evaluate the ADT angles and construct smooth, symmetric, and continuous diabatic PESs for molecular systems.
